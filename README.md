  # miniproject
We are going to make a game using Arduino, Adafruit oled screen and other basic electronics components.
In this game user will be able to control the character with the buttons. Using those buttons character will move left and right and character will save the friend(smilies) by catching them and user has to avoid catching enemies(dragon or monster).

The enemies and friends will come towards the user character, from which user has to save only smilies, if user catched enemy by mistake the game will over. If user catch smiley then it will increase the user scores. User scores will be shown and will continously updates on the top right corner of the Adafruit oled screen.
